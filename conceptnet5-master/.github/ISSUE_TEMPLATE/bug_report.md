<!-- Please do not use GitHub Issues to ask questions. It's not a good Q&A format. If you ask a question here, we will likely close it without answering it.

A better format for asking questions is the Gitter chat (https://gitter.im/commonsense/conceptnet5), a Web chat that you can connect to using your GitHub login. -->
